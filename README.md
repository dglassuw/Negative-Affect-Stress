# About this project 

This repo includes a compiled .rmd for a contained project using longitudinal mixed models, both Bayesian and Inferential. In this course project, I used publicly available data from the National Study of Daily Experiences (1996-1997) through the Midlife in the United States study to examine relationships between negative affect, daily stress experiences, age, and biological sex assigned at birth (original data term: gender). 

The data are available [here](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACDA/studies/3725#:~:text=The%20National%20Study%20of%20Daily,a%20subsample%20of%20MIDUS%20respondents)
